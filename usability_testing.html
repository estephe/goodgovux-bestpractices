<h4>Are you familiar with usability testing?</h4>
<ul><li>If you are new to usability testing and have no budget, you need to do some reading to learn more about usability testing ;-)</li>
<li>For an overview of usability testing take a look at this section on Usability.gov. To run an effective usability test, you need to develop a solid test plan, recruit participants, and then analyze and report your findings. For more detailed information on the testing process, scroll down to chapter 18  in these usability guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the goal of the testing? Might there be other types of user research that would better meet your needs? </h4>

<ul><li>If you are not sure what type of testing would best meet your goals, read about different types of user research techniques at Usability.gov</li></ul>
<h4>Are you looking for inexpensive ways to do usability testing? </h4>

<ul>
 <li> If you are looking for a step by step do it yourself guide to usability testing, consider Steve Krug's book  Rocket Surgery Made Easy. Per Steve, "Unlike other books about usability testing, Rocket Surgery also explains how to decide which problems to fix, and the kinds of changes you should make to fix them.<br />
(Hint: the smallest changes are often the best ones). </li>
</ul>

<h4> Do you need some standard tools and templates to use for your testing process?</h4>
<ul>
<li>If so, start with this page on the usability.gov site.</li>
<li>Remember, to run an effective usability test, you need to develop a solid test plan, recruit participants, and then analyze and report your findings.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Do you have customers that have accessibility requirements? Even if you think you don't, you still need to comply with Section 508 standards. </h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Social Security Administration has a Best Practices Library to help you make your site 508 compliant.  To learn more about 508 requirements in general, go to <a href="http://section508.gov">Section508.gov</a>.</li>
<li>As you find usability issues, make sure your solutions include 508 fixes as well. Retest your system against 508 guidelines after any updates or changes. </li>
<li>Remember: you're helping yourself by enabling your content to be more accessible by more customers across more channels.</li></ul>

<h4>Will you be testing to see if your website is compliant with the Plain Language Act? </h4>
<ul>
<li>The use of plain language on federal websites is the law. There are many resources available to you at the plainlanguage.gov website.  The Plain English At-a-glance section is an excellent place to start.</li>
<li>The folks at 18F (US Digital Services) also have some excellent guidance on plain language in their content guide.</li></ul>
<h4> Once you've conducted your usability test sessions, how do you plan to present your findings? </h4>
<ul><li>Reports of findings from usability testing sessions can take many different forms. </li>
<li>For simple testing, where all of the stakeholders have watched the testing sessions, you can simply compare your notes and discuss the findings.</li>
<li>For more formal reports,  take a look at this  template  on the usability.gov site.</li>
