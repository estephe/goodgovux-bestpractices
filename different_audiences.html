        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <h4>Do you have a handle on who your users are? </h4>
        
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
i.  The first step to improving the user experience of your site is to figure out who the users are (or who you want them to be). There are several ways to get information about the users of your site. You can conduct  online surveys, focus groups, contextual interviews , individual interviews.

<li>
iii.  Advanced topic: Personas Consider creating Personas. Personas allow you to design for a few representative users, while meeting the needs of many. To learn more, start with this introduction on audience segmentation.
<li>
iv. If you are interested additional information, take a look at this more detailed explanation of personas.
</ul>

       <h3>Analyze</h3>
        <h4>b) [Goals] What problems is the site meant to solve? It can't be all things to all people. </h4>
       
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
i.  Your user research should provide information on not just who your users are,  but also their needs and the tasks they are trying to complete using your site. You will want to make sure your organization's internal view of your audience(s) matches your user research on how the users think of themselves.</li>
<li>i. (Need a link here!) 
</ul>

</p>

<p>
c.   [Content] How do we decide what information we should keep on our site? 

</p>

  <ul>
<li>i.    Senior management must be clear about what business and user requirements the site should meet and who the audiences are. Any content that does not meet those criteria should be axed or archived for users who need it.</li>
    <li>ii.  Business requirements and audiences must be tied together and clearly stated. </li>
    <li>
iii. Once those connections have been made, develop functional requirements. </li>
<li>iv.  Then assess the current site. Where does it meet your requirements set? Where can the site be improved? Where are there gaps?</li>

  <li>v. Advanced topic: Journeys</li>
  <li>vi.  Consider creating User Journeys or workflows with post-its and a whiteboard. If you have several user types, you could make journeys for each type to see where they are similar and different. This will help you determine whether the site achieves the intended mission(s). For inspiration, take a look at this example of a journey in the form of a 'user experience wheel'</li>
</ul>


</p>

   
<h3>Design</h3>
        <h4>a.  [ Efficiency] How can you help visitors narrow the choices or access resources quickly as they browse? 
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>i.  Consider performing a card sorting activity and get your users input on what information is the most important and how they would like to see the site content organized. </li>
</ul>

        
 
<h3>Test and Refine</h3>

<ul>

  <li>      ii.  As you find usability issues, make sure your solutions include 508 fixes as well. Retest your system against 508 guidelines after any updates or changes. 
    <li>
iii. Remember: you're helping yourself by enabling your content to be more accessible by more customers across more channels.</ul>

<p>
b.   [Plain Language] Will you be testing to see if your website is compliant with the Plain Language Act? 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>i.  The use of plain language on federal websites is the law. There are many resources available to you at the plainlanguage.gov website.  The Plain English At-a-glance section is an excellent place to start.
    <li> ii. The folks at 18F (US Digital Services) also have some excellent guidance on plain language in their content guide.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
c.   [Reporting findings] Once you've conducted your usability test sessions, how do you plan to present your findings?
 <li>i.  Reports of findings from usability testing sessions can take many different forms.
 <li>ii. For simple testing, where all of the stakeholders have watched the testing sessions, you can simply compare your notes and discuss the findings. 
 <li>iii.  For more formal reports,  take a look at this  template  on the usability.gov site.
